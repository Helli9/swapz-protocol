Swapz Protocol - README
Overview
Swapz Protocol is a decentralized token swap protocol built on the Solana blockchain. This smart contract enables trustless token exchanges between users with minimal fees and maximum efficiency.

Features
Decentralized Token Swaps: Peer-to-peer token exchanges without intermediaries

Low Fees: Leverages Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs

Secure: Built with Rust and Solana's security best practices

Permissionless: Open for anyone to participate

Smart Contract Details
The Swapz Protocol smart contract is written in Rust and compiled to run on Solana's Sealevel runtime.

Key Functions:
Initialize Swap Pool: Creates a new liquidity pool for a token pair

Add Liquidity: Allows users to deposit tokens into a pool

Remove Liquidity: Allows liquidity providers to withdraw their funds

Swap Tokens: Executes token exchanges between users

Price Calculation: Automated market maker (AMM) formula determines exchange rates
